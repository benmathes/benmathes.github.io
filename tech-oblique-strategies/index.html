        Prompt to generate this app: "Create a web app with three decks of cards arranged horizontally. The left deck displays 'Original Oblique Strategies', the middle deck displays 'Technical Strategies', and the right deck displays 'Product/Business Strategies'. When any card is clicked, all three decks should flip simultaneously to show synchronized strategies (one original, one technical version, one product/business version). Each card should show a short bold message at the top and a longer light gray sentence description at the bottom."
