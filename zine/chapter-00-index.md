## The Arc

Reading the full archive reveals a pattern: periods of building, peaks of performance, inevitable injuries, patient recovery, and rebuilding again. The squash obsession emerged. The cycling was tried and abandoned. The mountains remained constant.

The body broke and healed. The mind needed stupid runs and head-clearing hikes. Work ground down and movement restored. Friends appeared on courts and trails and ski slopes.

This is what six years of movement looks like, captured in GPS tracks and heart rate data and titles that tell the truth.
