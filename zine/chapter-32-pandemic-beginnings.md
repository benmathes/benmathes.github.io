# Chapter 32: Where It All Began

*March 28 - May 2020*

## The Pandemic Era

The earliest records in the archive. March 2020 - when the world locked down and running through San Francisco neighborhoods became the primary form of movement. "Mission Sutro panhandle wiggle" - tracing a path through the suddenly quiet city.

### Mission Sutro Panhandle Wiggle
*March 28, 2020 | Run | 12 km*

The first recorded activity. A run that connected neighborhoods: the Mission, Sutro, the Panhandle, weaving through a city that had just shut down. The distance: nearly 12 kilometers. The purpose: staying sane when the world felt like it was ending.

### Fitbod - Everything
*March 30-31, 2020 | Weight Training*

Home workouts began. Chest, shoulders, lower back, abs. Then triceps, chest, glutes, shoulders, quadriceps, back. Every muscle group getting attention because the gym was closed and the living room became the weight room.

### Tiny Bit of Cardio After Body Weight at Home
*March 31, 2020 | Run | 2.3 km*

A short run, honestly labeled. "Tiny bit of cardio" after home bodyweight work. These were the days of making do, of finding what movement was possible in a locked-down world.

## The Origin Story

Looking at these first activities now, knowing everything that would follow - the squash obsession, the ski trips, the injuries and recoveries, the backpacking and cycling and all the rest - it all started here. In a pandemic. In a quiet city. With runs through empty streets and home workouts on living room floors.

The data begins March 28, 2020. Everything in this zine flows forward from that day.
