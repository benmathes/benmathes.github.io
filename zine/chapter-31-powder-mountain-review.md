### Powder Mountain: A Review
*February 11 | Alpine Ski*

> Legendary reputation, kinda disappointed.
>
> In short: despite advertising untouched cold powder, a midwinter day is just $250 for mostly slow lifts and dust on crust.
>
> Pretty underwhelming for the price, maybe good if you're a beginner/intermediate and try powder for the first time... for an extremely expensive lift ticket.

The honest review that marketers hate. Sometimes the legend doesn't match the lift line. 51 kilometers of skiing for $250, mostly disappointed. The data remembers even when the marketing forgets.
