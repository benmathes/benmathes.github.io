# Chapter 18: Reintroducing the Knee to Impact

*December 3, 2024 - January 18, 2025*

---

## The Knee Story

Before the calf, there was the knee. Another body part that needed convincing, another careful reintroduction to the activities it once took for granted.

---

### Reintroducing the Knee to Impact
*December 3 | Run*

The title says it all. The careful first steps of returning to running after the knee said no. Each footfall a question: are we okay? are we okay?

---

### Indoor Soulcycle
*December 4 | Ride*

Low impact while the knee rebuilds trust.

---

### Evening Rides in the Dark
*December 8-17 | Rides*

Midwinter cycling: leaving work at 5pm into darkness, lights blinking, the city different at night. Multiple rides through December, maintaining fitness while the knee decided what it would allow.

---

### Afternoon Run
*December 18 | Run*

Testing. Still careful.

---

### Afternoon Squash + Length Game w Gerard
*December 21-22 | Workouts*

The return to court. Playing length games - strategic, controlled, less explosive movement than the usual scramble.

---

### Looping Around Michele's Childhood Home
*December 25 | Run*

Christmas Day. A run through nostalgia, through someone else's memory lane. The knee along for the holiday.

---

### Length Game. Knee Feels Stable
*December 30 | Workout*

The verdict: stable. After weeks of careful reintroduction, the knee was ready to be trusted again. Not fully, not recklessly, but enough to play and move without constant monitoring.

---

### Morning Kneehab Test
*January 2 | Alpine Ski*

The real test: skiing. All the lateral forces, all the impact absorption. A morning on snow specifically to see what the knee would say. Apparently it said yes.

---

### Social Skis + Powder Morning + Sugar Pine Point
*January 2-5 | Nordic + Alpine*

The knee passed inspection. Multiple ski days followed - nordic with friends, alpine in powder, the trails at Sugar Pine Point. The body was whole again.

---

### Return to Full Squash
*January 10-18 | Workouts*

Multiple squash sessions. The knee holding. The confidence rebuilding.

---

### Struggle Bus Recovery Jog
*January 15 | Run*

"Struggle bus" is the honest term for those runs where nothing feels right but you do it anyway.
