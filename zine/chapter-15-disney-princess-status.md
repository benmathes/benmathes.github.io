# Chapter 15: Disney Princess Status Confirmed

*February 11 - February 23, 2025*

---

## February Snow

A ski trip that ran the gamut: bad conditions, surprise openings, getting soaked, and apparently achieving Disney princess status.

---

### Bad Conditions, Good Weather
*February 11 | Alpine Ski*

The trade-off. Sometimes the snow is terrible but the sun is out and you can't complain about blue skies even when your edges are scraping on ice.

---

### Afternoon Nordic Ski
*February 12 | Nordic Ski*

The peaceful alternative.

---

### Soaked
*February 13 | Alpine Ski*

One word says it all. When the weather turns wet and you stay out anyway, you come home drenched. Worth it? Probably.

---

### Storm Day and Huge Lines Turned into Surprise End of Day Upper Mountain Opening
*February 14 | Alpine Ski*

Valentine's Day skiing. The storms that cause lift closures also deposit fresh snow. Patience rewarded: late in the day, the upper mountain opened, and suddenly all that waiting was worth it.

---

### Disney Princess Status Confirmed
*February 15 | Nordic Ski*

What happens on a ski trail that confirms Disney princess status? Birds landing on your shoulder? Woodland creatures following in your tracks? The mystery remains, but the status is confirmed.

---

### Quick Jaunt Before Spa Afternoon
*February 16 | Nordic Ski*

The correct sequence: earn the relaxation with a morning ski, then sink into hot water knowing you've done the work.

---

### Afternoon Squash
*February 18 | Workout*

Back to the courts.

---

### Evening Squash
*February 21 | Workout*

The squash rhythm resumes.

---

### Gear Testing
*February 22 | Alpine Ski*

New equipment needs field testing. A ski day with purpose beyond just skiing.

---

### Morning Alpine Ski
*February 23 | Alpine Ski*

Early start, cold snow, the mountain waking up.
