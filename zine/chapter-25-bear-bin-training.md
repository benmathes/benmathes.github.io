## Preparing for the Sierra

The lead-up to backpacking season. Weighted hikes, crafty squash opponents, and the brilliant idea of filling an 11-liter bear bin with water.

### Fitbod - Quadriceps, Chest

Building base.

### Closing Weekend Spring Skiing

The last hurrah on snow. May skiing is earned skiing.

### Afternoon Hike

Post-ski hike. Moving differently.

### Fitbod + Squash Against a Crafty Shooter
*May 29 | Weight Training + Workout*

Some players are crafty. They find angles you didn't know existed, put the ball where you can't be. You lose, but you learn.

---

### Afternoon Squash Sessions
*May 31, June 3, June 6 | Workouts*

The rhythm.

---

### Lunch Yoga + Slow Burn Sunday
*June 9 | Yoga + Run*

The longer the run, the slower the burn. Sunday pace: sustainable, meditative, miles accumulating without urgency.

### Apparently Nursing a Small Illness
*June 15 | Workout*

Playing through something. Probably shouldn't. Did anyway.

---

### Morning Hike + Weighted Hike

Training for the pack. Building the capacity.

Luke visiting, games played.

---

### Filled an 11 Liter Bear Bin w Water for a Weighted Hike
*June 25 | Hike*

The innovation: a bear canister holds about 11 liters of water (24 pounds). Strap it to your back and you've simulated a full pack. The Sierra was coming; the body needed preparation.

---

### Drills Then 5 Games + Supplemental Weights
*June 28 | Workout + Weight Training*

Squash structure plus gym finish.

---

### Back on the Big Wheels

Still cycling at this point. The breakup letter hadn't been written yet.
