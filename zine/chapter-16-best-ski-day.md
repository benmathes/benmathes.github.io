# Chapter 16: Best Ski Day of My Life

*March 1 - March 21, 2025*

---

## The Canada Trip

The headline: March 20th was the best ski day of a lifetime. But the days around it set the stage - backcountry touring, cat skiing, Rogers Pass, and a trip to Mustang Powder.

### Lunch Backcountry Ski
*March 1 | Backcountry Ski*

Earning turns. No lifts, just skinning up and skiing down, the mountain experienced at human pace.

---

### Beautiful Looking Snow on Top of Rock Hard Ice
*March 2 | Alpine Ski*

The visual deception: the surface looks pillowy, but underneath it's armor. Every turn a negotiation with hidden ice.

---

### Afternoon Squash
*March 4 | Workout*

Home court maintenance between trips.

---

### Afternoon Yoga
*March 6 | Yoga*

Pre-trip preparation.

---

### League Match Lost in Four but Played Well
*March 7 | Workout*

The dignified loss. When you play well and still lose, you tip your hat to the opponent and move on.

---

### Evening Squash
*March 11 | Workout*

The last session before the big trip.

---

## Canada

### Day One of Canada Trip
*March 16 | Alpine Ski*

Landing in the north, legs fresh, anticipation high.

---

### Rogers Pass Morning
*March 17 | Backcountry Ski*

Rogers Pass - legendary terrain, legendary avalanche history, legendary skiing. A morning in the backcountry here is not like anywhere else.

---

### Cat Day 1
*March 18 | Alpine Ski*

Cat skiing: a snowcat hauls you up, you ski down, repeat. All the fresh snow, none of the lift lines.

---

### Forgot to Start Recording Until a Few Hours In
*March 19 | Alpine Ski*

When the skiing is so good you forget you have a watch. The data is incomplete; the memory isn't.

---

### Best Ski Day of My Life
*March 20 | Alpine Ski*

There it is. No description needed beyond the title, because what could possibly capture it? Some days transcend documentation. The snow was right, the company was right, the mountain was right. Everything aligned, and for one day, skiing was exactly what you always imagined it could be.

---

### Last Day at Mustang
*March 21 | Alpine Ski*

The bittersweet final run. Leaving Mustang Powder behind, heading home with legs tired and heart full.
