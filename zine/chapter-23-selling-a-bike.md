# Chapter 23: I'm Selling a Bike

*July 1 - July 17, 2024*

---

## The Summer of Realization

July 2024. A Tallac sunrise, a cycling epiphany, and the moment when Chappell Roan made someone prance.

---

### Afternoon Squash
*July 1 | Workout*

The usual.

---

### Most of Stanford Rock
*July 3 | Ride*

A big climb, almost completed. "Most of" is still a lot.

---

### Tallac Sunrise
*July 4 | Hike*

Independence Day, earned at elevation. Mount Tallac in the dark, waiting for the sun, the lake below still sleeping.

### Night Hike
*July 4 | Hike*

The approach in darkness, headlamps cutting through pre-dawn.

### I'm Glad Some of You Enjoy This Sport But I Don't Understand Why
*July 5 | Ride*

> Plus the gear costs and maintenance tasks.
> Anyway I'm selling a bike.

The breakup letter to cycling. After miles and climbs and gear purchases, the verdict was in: not for me. Some sports are acquired tastes you never acquire. The bike went on the market; the squash racquet stayed in the bag.

---

### Lunch Hike + Evening Hike
*July 6-9 | Hikes*

Hiking, on the other hand, remained reliable.

---

### Fitbod - Legs Balance
*July 9 | Weight Training*

Building what the trails require.

---

### Afternoon Squash + Morning Squash
*July 12-13 | Workouts*

The true love. No breakup letters here.

---

### Ended Up Prancing When Chappell Roan Came On
*July 16 | Run*

The moment when a run becomes a music video. The right song at the right time can transform a plod into a prance. Chappell Roan provided that transformation.

---

### Afternoon Squash
*July 17 | Workout*

Back to basics.

---

*Chapter 23 Complete*

**Stats:** 12 activities | Bikes for sale: 1 | Sports that didn't work out: 1 (cycling) | Songs that induced prancing: 1
