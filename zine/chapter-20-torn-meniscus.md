## Another Injury Origin Story

Before the knee was rehabbed, it was torn. This is that story - the pivot to vanity muscles, the careful reintroduction, the existential question of identity.

### Can't Do Legs w a Knee Injury So Vanity Muscles It Is
*October 10 | Weight Training*

The adaptation. When the knee says no to squats and deadlifts, you do what you can. Chest, arms, shoulders - the muscles that show but don't require functional knees.

### Reintroducing the Knee to Work
*October 19 | Ride*

Nine days later, the first test. Cycling: low impact, controlled motion, the knee allowed to move without the jarring of running or the lateral stress of squash.

### The Triple Header
*October 19 | Elliptical + Ride + Elliptical*

Testing the limits. Multiple short sessions, different machines, gathering data on what the knee would tolerate.

### HIIT on the Torn Meniscus
*October 22 | Ride*

A spin class at home, pushing into higher intensity. The meniscus was torn but apparently not torn enough to prevent HIIT. Bodies are strange - they break and then negotiate new terms.

### Meniscus Injury Turns Me Into a Basic B**ch?
*October 23 | Ride*

The identity crisis. When your usual activities are off-limits, you become someone who does spin classes. The question mark is important - it's not a statement, it's an inquiry. Who are you when you can't do the things that define you?

### Living Right on a Great Loop
*October 26 | Ride*

Finding new joy in the available options. A great loop, fully appreciated because it's what you can do.
