# Chapter 21: Falls and Finishers

*September 5 - October 1, 2024*

---

## Early Fall

September 2024. The squash rhythm strong, Telegraph Hill getting climbed repeatedly, and one hike that left some marks.

---

### Fitbod - Legs Balance
*September 5 | Weight Training*

Building the foundation.

---

### Soloing Squash
*September 6 | Workout*

Solo practice. You against the wall, the ball coming back every time until you miss.

---

### Social Round Robin Plus Telegraph Hill Finisher
*September 7 | Workout*

Squash with friends, followed by the mandatory Telegraph Hill steps. The finisher that never gets easier.

---

### Walk in the Park
*September 9 | Hike*

Low-key movement. Sometimes that's all it is.

---

### Afternoon Squash + Evening Squash + Fitbod
*September 11-12 | Workouts + Weight Training*

The double-header days. Squash appetite high, body willing.

---

### Nice Views But a Fall on an Offtrail Section Cut Me Up Pretty Good
*September 14 | Hike*

The hike that drew blood. Off-trail adventures come with off-trail consequences. Nice views, though. That part was true.

---

### Tram Was Closed So We Ended Up Going Much Longer
*September 15 | Hike*

When Plan A fails, Plan B becomes the adventure. The closed tram meant extra miles, extra elevation, extra everything.

---

### Tooling Around
*September 18 | Run*

No agenda, just movement.

---

### Fitbod + Afternoon Squash
*September 20 | Weight Training + Workout*

Building and playing.

---

### 35lb Weighted Hike
*September 22 | Hike*

Training with load. The pack doesn't lie about your fitness.

---

### Fitbod + Afternoon Hike
*September 25 - October 1 | Weight Training + Hike*

The rhythm continues into October.
