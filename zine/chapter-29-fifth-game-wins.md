# Chapter 29: Fifth Game Wins

*March 14 - April 12, 2024*

---

## The Grind of March

Deep into squash season. Matches going the distance, powder days squeezed between, the body running ragged but finding wins.

---

### Recovery Run After Loaded Mobility
*March 14 | Run*

Thirty minutes of weighted mobility work, then a run. The combination that keeps the joints happy.

---

### Afternoon Squash
*March 15 | Workout*

Standard session.

---

### Eked Out a 12-10 Win in the Fifth
*March 17 | Workout*

> Ran ragged tho.

12-10 in the fifth game. That's as close as squash gets - sudden death territory, whoever gets to 11 with a two-point lead. Running ragged is the price of winning games like this. Worth it.

### Core and Lower Body Stability
*March 17 | Weight Training*

Post-match maintenance. The body that was just pushed to its limit needs immediate attention.

---

### Recovery Run Between Meets
*March 19 | Run*

Tournament season means meets stacked close together. The recovery run between: keeping loose, staying ready.

---

### Morning Squash
*March 20 | Workout*

Before the next event.

---

### League Squash: 11-9, 7-11, 11-8, 4-11, 11-8
*March 22 | Workout*

The scoreline tells the story: back and forth, two games each, fifth game deciding. 11-8 in the decider. Another battle won on heart.

### Fitbod - Legs Balance
*March 22 | Weight Training*

Recovery for the road ahead.

---

### Morning Backcountry + Afternoon Alpine
*March 23 | Backcountry Ski + Alpine Ski*

Squash legs to ski legs. Morning in the backcountry earning turns, afternoon on the resort consuming them.

---

### Crazy Good Powder Day
*March 24 | Alpine Ski*

The reward for keeping skis waxed in late March. When powder comes, you have to be ready.

---

### Squash Session Focusing on Movement
*March 26 | Workout*

Technical work. Not just playing, but drilling the movement patterns that make wins possible.

---

### Fitbod + Afternoon Ride
*March 27 | Weight Training + Ride*

Cross-training.

---

### Lunch Alpine + Surprise Squawllywood Day + Homewood Afternoon
*March 29-30 | Alpine Ski x3*

A weekend of skiing. "Squawllywood" - when Palisades Tahoe (formerly Squaw Valley) gets the goods. Three sessions in two days.

---

### Fitbod + Afternoon Squash
*April 1-5 | Weight Training + Workout*

Early April continuation.

---

### Parents in Town + Evening Squash: Hardest Run in Months
