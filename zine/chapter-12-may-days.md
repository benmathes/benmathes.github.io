# Chapter 12: May Days

*April 23 - May 13, 2025*

---

## Spring Settling In

More skiing squeezed out of the season, new trails discovered, and the rhythm of squash-lift-repeat.

---

### Afternoon Yoga + Found a New Path Through Mount Sutro
*April 23 | Yoga + Run*

The gift of familiar terrain: sometimes you take a wrong turn and find a better way. Mount Sutro's forest hides paths you don't know exist until you stumble onto them.

---

### Mobility and Squats
*April 24 | Weight Training*

Full range of motion work, finished with squats. The maintenance that keeps everything else possible.

---

### Afternoon Squash + Fitbod Legs
*April 26 | Workout + Weight Training*

The doubleheader continues.

---

### Lunch Squash + Post-Squash Finisher
*April 27 | Workout + Weight Training*

Sunday squash energy, followed by the obligatory destruction.

---

### Head Clearing Hike
*April 30 | Hike*

The end of April. Sometimes a hike isn't about fitness; it's about sanity.

### Afternoon Squash
*April 30 | Workout*

Back to the court.

---

### Three Days of Alpine Ski
*May 2-4 | Alpine Ski x3*

The last hurrah. Three days of skiing in early May:
- May 2: Afternoon ski
- May 3: Afternoon ski
- May 4: "Low vis high fun" - when you can't see and it doesn't matter

---

### Afternoon Squash
*May 6 | Workout*

Transition back from snow to court.

---

### Slow Sanity Ride + Afternoon Squash + Telegraph Hill Finisher
*May 10 | Ride + Workout + Run*

Triple threat day. Cycling for sanity, squash for sport, Telegraph Hill steps for punishment. May is not for the lazy.

---

### Luke Was Local
*May 13 | Workout*

Luke visiting again. Squash with friends who actually show up makes the game matter more.
