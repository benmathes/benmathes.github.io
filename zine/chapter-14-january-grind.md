# Chapter 14: The January Grind

*January 20 - February 6, 2025*

---

## Deep Winter

January. The days are short, the snow is hard, and you learn things like "it's uphill on the way back from the ocean."

---

### Sunset Stroll
*January 20 | Ride*

A winter sunset on two wheels.

---

### Ran to the Ocean, Re-learned That It's Uphill on the Way Back
*January 22 | Run*

San Francisco geography lesson #47: the ocean is at sea level. You are not. Every run to Ocean Beach is a pleasant downhill followed by the reality of return.

---

### Evening Squash + Fitbod Quadriceps
*January 24 | Workout + Weight Training*

The evening double.

---

### Frozen and Hard
*January 25 | Alpine Ski*

The conditions. Early-season snow that's been worked over by cold and wind. Not glamorous, but you take what the mountain gives.

---

### Morning Nordic Ski
*January 26 | Nordic Ski*

Cross-country in the cold. The quiet alternative to chairlifts.

---

### Hike and Catch Up on Industry News
*January 28 | Hike*

Multitasking: legs moving, brain processing podcasts or articles, both needs met simultaneously.

### Cold Groomers at End of Day for Zoomies
*January 28 | Alpine Ski*

The specific joy of empty groomers at last chair. When the slopes clear out and you can finally open up, the "zoomies" hit - pure speed for speed's sake.

---

### Groggy and Got Beat Up
*January 29 | Workout*

Some squash days you show up tired and leave more tired. The game doesn't care about your sleep schedule.

---

### Afternoon Ride
*January 31 | Ride*

End of January movement.

---

### Legs Tired, Joints Don't Hurt
*February 1 | Run*

The body check-in. Muscle fatigue is honest work. Joint pain is a warning. This day: honest work.

---

### Have Some Small Cold Still
*February 6 | Run*

Running through minor illness. Probably shouldn't. Did anyway.

---
