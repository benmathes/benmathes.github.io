# Chapter 22: Forester Pass

*July 22 - August 21, 2024*

---

## High Sierra

The summer centerpiece: a backpacking trip into the Sierra high country. Forester Pass - the highest point on the John Muir Trail - and the days around it.

---

### Long Day w Nearly Full Packs
*July 22 | Hike*

The approach. Heavy packs, long miles, the slow march into wilderness.

---

### Hike the Packs Down to a New Base Camp, Day Hike Up Into Vidette Basin
*July 25 | Hike*

The strategy of backpacking: move the house, then explore light. Vidette Basin - granite and sky and the particular silence of altitude.

---

### Up to Forester Pass
*July 26 | Hike*

The climb. 13,153 feet at the top, the highest point the trail touches. The air thin, the views endless, the satisfaction of standing where the continent divides.

## Return to Civilization

### L4 Area Still Pinches on Deadlifts
*August 1 | Weight Training*

Back in the gym, back to discovering what the trail did to the body. The lower back, apparently, was not entirely happy about all those loaded miles.

---

### Pre-Flight Resistance and Mobility
*August 4 | Weight Training*

Travel day prep. Keeping things moving before being compressed into an airplane seat.

---

### Squash After Two Weeks Away = Pain
*August 8 | Workout*

The return to court after wilderness. The body had adapted to hiking pace; squash pace was a rude awakening.

---

### Squash Round Robin, Light Weights
*August 10 | Workout*

Easing back in.

---

### Quick Hit After Work
*August 12 | Run*

Short and purposeful.

---

### Squash: 20 Mins Drills, 5 Games
*August 15 | Workout*

Structure returning to the squash practice.

---

### Some Runs Feel Effortless and Float By
*August 16 | Run*

The good kind. When everything clicks and the miles disappear under your feet without asking for much in return.

---

### Pete Got Me By a Little as Usual
*August 18 | Workout*

Squash rivalry. Pete with the edge, as usual. The familiar loss that motivates the next session.

---

### Telegraph Hill Steps Finisher
*August 19 | Run*

That finisher again. Always there, always hard.

---

### Morning Squash
*August 21 | Workout*

The rhythm re-established.

---
