# Chapter 19: Pre-Feast Fasted

*October 28 - December 2, 2024*

---

## Fall into Winter

The transition season. Bad Peloton instructors, Thanksgiving skiing, and the slow march toward the shortest days.

---

### Twin Peaks 3 Ways
*October 28 | Ride*

Three routes up Twin Peaks, apparently. The city's signature climb, tackled from every angle.

---

### Afternoon Elliptical
*October 31 | Elliptical*

Halloween on the elliptical. Not glamorous, but documented.

---

### Presidio, Lands End
*November 2 | Run*

San Francisco's northwestern corner. Where the city meets the ocean, where the Presidio forests give way to coastal cliffs.

---

### Work Has a Peloton Bike. Tried 3 Classes. No Good Instructors
*November 7 | Ride*

The review is in: three chances, zero recommendations. Sometimes the hype doesn't match the reality.

---

### 45 Min Soulcycle Hungover
*November 10 | Ride*

The punishment workout. Sweating out whatever the night before deposited. Forty-five minutes of regret processed through the pedals.

---

### Afternoon Rides + Evening Yoga
*November 12-13 | Ride + Yoga*

Standard mid-week movement.

---

### Zone 2 Different Paces
*November 20 | Ride*

Training speak: Zone 2 is the aerobic base, the sustainable effort. Playing with paces within that zone, finding the edges.

---

### Evening Ride + Sunday Stroll + Hard Push
*November 22-25 | Rides + Hike*

Pre-Thanksgiving preparations. The activity before the eating.

---

### Actually an Indoor Stationary Cycle
*November 26 | Run (mislabeled)*

Data hygiene failure. Logged as a run, actually a bike. The machines don't always know.

---

### Pre-Feast Fasted
*November 28 | Nordic Ski*

Thanksgiving morning. Skiing on an empty stomach, earning the feast to come. The Puritan ethic of sport: you must suffer before you may eat.

---

### Offtrail Snow Hike w Skis + Nice Long Snow Hike
*November 29-30 | Nordic Ski*

Post-Thanksgiving snow adventures. Skis on feet, trails optional, the world white and quiet.
