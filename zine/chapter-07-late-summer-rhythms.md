# Chapter 7: Late Summer Rhythms

*August 27 - September 9, 2025*

---

## The August-September Transition

The tail end of summer. Hot days, busy trails, the particular rhythm of workouts squeezed around work conferences and wrong dates and the general chaos of life.

### Fitbod - Quadriceps, Back
*August 27 | Weight Training*

Building the engine. Quads and back - the muscles that power everything else. The database doesn't capture the satisfaction of heavy squats, just the cold math of weight and reps.

---

### Hot and Busy Out There
*August 31 | Ride*

A ride on the last day of August. Hot and busy - the kind of day where everyone else has the same idea and the trails become a exercise in navigation. Still worth it.

---

### Solo Practice Because I Got the Date Wrong
*September 1 | Workout*

Showed up to squash with no opponent. Wrong date. But the court was booked, so solo practice it was - drills against the wall, movement patterns, the meditative rhythm of ball against front wall, ball against floor, repeat.

### Fitbod - Legs Balance
*September 1 | Weight Training*

Post-solo-practice legs work. Might as well make use of the accidental court time by destroying the legs properly afterward.

---

### Afternoon Ride
*September 4 | Ride*

Midweek movement. No description, no drama, just pedaling through the city.

---

### Pre Work Conference Pre-Relaxation
*September 5 | Workout | 7,820 lb lifted*

The title tells a story: a workout squeezed in before a work conference, trying to find calm in iron before finding calm in... whatever work conferences require. Nearly eight thousand pounds lifted as pre-relaxation. Some of us have odd definitions of relaxation.

---

### Evening Yoga
*September 9 | Yoga*

A reset. Breath and stretch after days of intensity.

### These Hills and These Parks
*September 9 | Run*

Running through familiar terrain. The hills that never get easier, the parks that always reward the effort. San Francisco in early September, when the fog pulls back and the city shows off.
