# Chapter 28: Cortina

*February 25 - March 12, 2024*

---

## The Italian Alps

A ski trip to Cortina d'Ampezzo - the Dolomites, Italian style. Jet lag, corporate drama, zoomies in stunning surroundings, and a snorkeling detour.

---

### Jet Lag Reset
*February 25 | Run*

The trick to surviving Europe time: force the body to move when it wants to sleep. Running off the hours of sitting, resetting the clock.

---

### Fitbod - Quadriceps, Back
*February 26 | Weight Training*

Hotel gym, probably. Keeping the machine running.

---

### Running Off Some Curveball Corporate Bull
*February 29 | Run*

Even in the Italian Alps, work finds you. Running the stress out, one angry kilometer at a time.

---

### Afternoon Alpine Ski
*March 1 | Alpine Ski*

The first ski day in Italy.

---

### Cortina Two Ways
*March 2 | Alpine Ski*

Two directions, two aspects, two ways to experience the Dolomites.

---

### Zoomies in Stunning Surroundings
*March 3 | Alpine Ski*

The Dolomites are dramatic - spires and towers of rock rising above white slopes. The skiing matched the landscape: fast, joyful, the pure expression of "zoomies" in adult form.

---

### Fourth Cortina Day
*March 4 | Alpine Ski*

Day four of the Italian adventure. The legs knowing the terrain now, the body adapted to altitude.

---

## The Beach Detour

### Morning Snorkel + Afternoon Hike
*March 7 | Swim + Hike*

From snow to water. A snorkeling session marks the pivot from mountains to... somewhere warmer.

---

### Lunch Swim + Afternoon Ride
*March 8-9 | Swim + Ride*

Vacation mode: swimming and cycling, no elevation required.

---

### Afternoon Swim
*March 10 | Swim*

More water. The shoulders getting a different kind of workout.

---

### Evening Squash
*March 12 | Workout*

Back home, back to the courts.
