# Chapter 26: Regional Finals

*May 8 - May 23, 2024*

---

## Peak Squash Season

The culmination of the squash year: Regional Finals. Plus a hot court, a competitor who'd had two beers, and the aftermath of competition.

---

### Morning Squash + Post Squash Leg Finisher
*May 8 | Workout + Weight Training*

The rhythm continues.

---

### Hot Court + Tom Had Two Beers
*May 10 | Workout*

Hot court, managed to slow down and control. But also Tom had two beers before playing.

The advantages even out sometimes. A hot court forces pace changes; a slightly impaired opponent levels the field. The result: managed control and documented victory (implied).

---

### Fitbod + Morning Squash
*May 10-12 | Weight Training + Workout*

Building toward the big day.

---

### Lunch Yoga + Afternoon Run + Fitbod
*May 15 | Yoga + Run + Weight Training*

Triple session day. Either peaking or overdoing it.

---

### Afternoon Hike + Evening Hike
*May 16-18 | Hikes*

Moving differently before competition.

---

### Regional Squash Finals
*May 18 | Workout*

The main event. The culmination of club play, the test of all those court hours. No description in the data, but some things speak for themselves.

---

### Post Squash: Treadmill + Elliptical + Fitbod
*May 18 | Run + Elliptical + Weight Training*

After the finals, three more activities. Either flush-out recovery or the restless energy of competition finding other outlets.

---

### Quick Anaerobic
*May 20 | Run*

Short, hard, fast. The opposite of recovery.

---

### Slow Long Recovery
*May 22 | Run*

The actual recovery. Finally slowing down.

---

### Full Range of Motion, Light Weights
*May 22 | Weight Training*

PT gains locked in. The maintenance work.

---

### Afternoon Squash
*May 23 | Workout*

Back to normal programming.

---
