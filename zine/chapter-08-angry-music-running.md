# Chapter 8: Angry Music Running

*August 13 - August 25, 2025*

---

## Mid-August

The dog days. When motivation requires angry music from your youth and the mind wanders so far the legs have to cash checks they didn't write.

---

### Pre-Lifting Yoga
*August 13 | Yoga*

Stretching before strength. The proper order of operations.

### Fitbod - Quadriceps, Back
*August 13 | Weight Training*

The main event. Legs and back, the foundation of everything.

---

### Afternoon Yoga
*August 14 | Yoga*

A recovery day. Or at least a recovery moment.

### Tooling Around Golden Gate Park to Clear the Head
*August 14 | Run*

The title says it all. Not running for fitness or pace, just running to shake loose whatever was stuck in the head. Golden Gate Park is good for that - the paths wind without demanding decisions, the trees absorb whatever you're carrying.

---

### Fitbod - Shoulders, Quadriceps
*August 16 | Weight Training*

More building. Shoulders and legs this time.

---

### My Wandering Mind Wrote a Check My Legs Had to Cash
*August 19 | Run*

Every runner knows this feeling. You zone out, lost in thought or podcast or music, and suddenly you're far from home and the return journey is the legs' problem. The mind wanders; the legs pay.

---

### Afternoon Squash
*August 20 | Workout*

Back on court. The summer squash schedule - less frequent but still present.

---

### Afternoon Squash
*August 22 | Workout*

Another session. Building toward the September peak that was coming.

---

### Evening Yoga
*August 25 | Yoga*

Restorative work after days of effort.

### When the Angry Angst Music of Your Youth Is What Clicks, Time for a Short Run with PRs
*August 25 | Run*

Sometimes the body knows what it needs before the mind does. When the playlist shuffles to the angry music from decades ago and suddenly that's all you want to hear, it's time to run. And apparently run hard - PRs don't happen by accident.

There's something about those songs you screamed along to at fifteen that unlocks a different gear. Not because you're still angry about whatever you were angry about then, but because that energy is still in there somewhere, waiting to be called upon.
