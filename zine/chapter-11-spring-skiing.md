# Chapter 11: Spring Skiing

*April 5 - April 20, 2025*

---

## The Last of the Snow

Spring in California means stolen ski days between squash sessions. When friends align and weather cooperates, you grab what the mountains are still offering.

---

### Morning Hike
*April 5 | Hike*

Early spring. The trails drying out, the days lengthening.

---

### Afternoon Squash
*April 8 | Workout*

The squash rhythm continues.

---

### Afternoon Squash + Leg Finisher
*April 11 | Workout + Weight Training*

Squash followed by legs, ending with the Telegraph Hill steps. Those steps are either punishment or reward depending on how you frame it.

---

### Worst Squash Day in Maybe Five+ Years
*April 15 | Workout*

The title is the story. Every athlete has these days - when nothing works, when the ball mocks you, when skills you've had for years temporarily desert you. Five years of squash, and this was the bottom.

### Fitbod - Quadriceps, Hamstrings
*April 15 | Weight Training*

Post-worst-day lifting. Either therapy or self-flagellation.

---

### Evening Ride
*April 17 | Ride*

Moving on from the squash disaster.

---

### Watch Died - 40 Min Four Game Match
*April 19 | Workout*

Technology fails but the games don't stop. Forty minutes of squash, unrecorded except in memory.

### Great Spring Day, Impromptu 8 Friends Party Ski
*April 19 | Alpine Ski*

This is what spring skiing is for. Eight friends, one mountain, an impromptu party on snow. The kind of day that reminds you why you tolerate all the worst days.

---

### Morning Solo Hot Laps
*April 20 | Alpine Ski*

The day after the party, back up alone. Hot laps - fast runs, no waiting, the mountain to yourself before anyone else shows up.
