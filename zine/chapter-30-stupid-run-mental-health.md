# Chapter 30: Stupid F'ing Run for Mental Health

*January 10 - February 4, 2024*

---

## January

The honest month. When runs are labeled for what they actually are, hangovers are processed with goats, and the mind requires stupid f'ing runs for its stupid f'ing maintenance.

---

### Dusk->Night Hike in New Snow
*January 10 | Hike*

The transition from day to dark, fresh snow softening every sound.

Court time.

### Recovery Jaunt

Light movement.

---

### Hangover Run with Goats
*January 14 | Run*

The best running companions ask no questions and judge no choices. Goats don't care what you drank last night; they just want to graze nearby while you sweat it out.

Triple header.

The body's warning system. Starting too fast has consequences; the stomach delivered the message clearly.

A ski weekend. Morning starts, cold snow, the January window when conditions peak.

Maintenance.

### Stupid F'ing Run for My Stupid F'ing Mental Health
*January 29 | Run*

The title that doesn't need explanation because everyone has these runs. The ones where you don't want to go, where the mind is fighting itself, where the only treatment is movement - stupid as it feels, f'ing necessary as it is.

---

### Afternoon Squash
*January 29 | Workout*

Later the same day. The run worked.

---

### Afternoon Run
*February 1 | Run*

The next chapter beginning.

---

### Afternoon Alpine Ski + Unexpected Saturday
*February 2-3 | Alpine Ski*

Low crowds, great snow. Unexpected Saturday. When the forecast, the schedule, and the conditions all align without planning.

---

### Lunch Alpine Ski
*February 4 | Alpine Ski*

Midday turns.

---
