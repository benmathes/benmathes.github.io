# Morning Trail Run

Beautiful crisp morning on the local trails.

## Stats

## Notes

Started slow, felt stiff for the first mile but loosened up on the climb. The creek crossing was icy - had to hop rocks carefully.

Saw a deer near the overlook. Perfect way to start the week.

**Next time:** Try the longer loop via the ridge trail.
