                misuse: "Used to justify short-term thinking, dismiss long-term consequences, or wave away concerns about debt/deficits. Often invoked at dinner parties to sound sophisticated while advocating for present gratification.",
                context: "Keynes wrote this in 'A Tract on Monetary Reform' criticizing economists who said inflation would sort itself out 'in the long run.' He was attacking passivity, not endorsing it.",
                meaning: "Keynes was saying: don't hide behind long-run equilibrium as an excuse for inaction NOW. It's a call for active policy intervention, not a license for fiscal recklessness. He wanted economists to solve today's problems today.",

                attribution: "Often attributed to Keynes",
                misuse: "Cited to justify why smart people lose money, or to explain away any market movement that doesn't match predictions. Used as an excuse for being wrong.",
                context: "There's no evidence Keynes ever said this. The earliest known attribution is from the 1990s. Keynes was actually a successful investor who grew King's College Cambridge's endowment substantially.",
                meaning: "While the sentiment has merit (markets don't always reflect fundamentals short-term), attributing it to Keynes gives it false authority. The quote is folk wisdom dressed in academic clothing.",

                misuse: "Invoked constantly to argue markets self-regulate perfectly and government intervention is always bad. Treated as Smith's central thesis and the foundation of free-market economics.",
                context: "Smith used the phrase exactly THREE times across all his works. In Wealth of Nations, it appears once, in a passage about domestic vs foreign investment—not as a general theory of markets.",
                meaning: "Smith was describing a specific phenomenon: merchants preferring domestic investment for safety reasons, unintentionally benefiting the nation. He wasn't claiming markets magically optimize everything. Smith also wrote extensively about the need for public goods and regulation.",

                context: "Friedman was making a specific empirical claim about sustained inflation over long periods, not one-time price increases. He was responding to cost-push inflation theories.",
                meaning: "Friedman meant that sustained, long-term inflation requires monetary accommodation. A supply shock causes a one-time price adjustment, not ongoing inflation, unless the central bank keeps printing. Context matters: 'sustained' and 'everywhere' are doing heavy lifting.",

                misuse: "Quoted to argue government should do nothing, ever. Used to oppose any public program, regulation, or investment regardless of context.",
                context: "This was Reagan's inaugural address during stagflation and the aftermath of the 1970s energy crisis. He was critiquing specific government overreach, not arguing for anarchism.",
                meaning: "Even Reagan increased government spending, grew the federal workforce, and supported Social Security. The quote is rhetorical framing, not policy prescription. Reagan governed far more pragmatically than the quote suggests.",

                context: "Schumpeter was DESCRIBING capitalism's inherent instability, not CELEBRATING it. He actually predicted capitalism would eventually destroy itself through this process.",
                meaning: "Schumpeter saw creative destruction as capitalism's engine AND its potential doom. He thought it would lead to a form of socialism as large corporations bureaucratized innovation. It's descriptive, not prescriptive—and certainly not an endorsement of disruption-for-disruption's-sake.",

                context: "The phrase predates Friedman (it's from 1930s-40s bars offering 'free lunch' with drink purchase). Friedman popularized it to explain opportunity costs and trade-offs, not to oppose all public goods.",
                meaning: "It's about opportunity costs: resources used for X can't be used for Y. This doesn't mean public goods are bad—it means we should consider trade-offs. Public education has costs AND benefits. The phrase is about clear thinking, not automatic opposition to spending.",

                context: "Coolidge actually said: 'The CHIEF business of the American people is business.' And he continued: 'Of course the accumulation of wealth cannot be justified as the chief end of existence.'",
                meaning: "The full speech emphasizes that while commerce is important, idealism and spiritual values matter more. Coolidge was arguing AGAINST pure materialism. The misquote inverts his point.",

                context: "Oliver Stone wrote this as satire. Gekko is the antagonist who ends up in prison. The movie is a critique of 1980s financial culture, not an endorsement.",
                meaning: "Using a fictional villain's speech to justify real-world behavior is peak missing-the-point. It's like quoting Darth Vader on management philosophy. The quote exists to be criticized.",

                meaning: "Kennedy was arguing FOR active government investment to spread prosperity. The metaphor has been hijacked to mean its opposite: that enriching the wealthy passively benefits the poor. Kennedy wanted to lift the tide; the misuse assumes it lifts itself.",

                misuse: "Used to argue all government assistance is harmful or unwanted. Invoked to oppose disaster relief, healthcare, social programs, etc.",
                context: "Reagan said this at a press conference as a joke, in the context of farm policy debates. It was meant as humor about federal bureaucracy, not a serious policy position.",
                meaning: "Taking a quip and treating it as philosophy leads to absurdity. By this logic, firefighters, food safety inspectors, and the military are all 'terrifying.' Reagan himself expanded government in many areas. It's a laugh line, not a governing principle.",

                misuse: "While often used correctly, it's sometimes weaponized to dismiss any expert who works in a field. 'Of course the climate scientist believes in climate change—they're paid to!' This inverts the quote into anti-intellectualism.",
                context: "Sinclair wrote this after his socialist campaign for California governor, describing why establishment figures opposed reform that would affect their interests.",
                meaning: "Sinclair was critiquing motivated reasoning by those with financial stakes in the status quo—not dismissing all expertise. The quote explains why incumbents resist change, not why we should distrust all professionals. It's about conflicts of interest, not a license to ignore evidence.",
